# Electronical part
You can use these files to modify the circuits and PCBs made for this project.

## Reworkings
- The linear regulator that is used in the DriverPCB design, is not found in the market. You can use other regulators with the same case style, but the function of each pin is different.
- The pads of the RGB leds in EncoderPCB. Pin 1 has to be put as cathode, and the rest (2, 3 and 4) as anode.
