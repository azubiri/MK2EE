# MK2EE
## Introduction
The main goal of this project is a fabrication of robotic arm. This project is based on a previous project that is called [MK2Plus](https://www.instructables.com/Robot-Arm-MK2-Plus-Stepper-Motor-Used/). This previous project is a purpose which the joints of the robot are moved by stepper motors instead of servo motors like another project [EEZYbotARM MK2](http://www.eezyrobots.it/eba_mk2.html).

These additions which are implemented in this project are the following:
* Rotatory information of the joints that are provided by magnetic encoders.
* All electronic is integrated in the robot.
* Stressfuls for cables are avoided.

In this repository you will find the several files to replicate and improve this purposed robotic arm. It is structured by the mechanical part, electronic part and software that have been used to test the electronic part. In addition, there is anohter folder where you will find some software tools.

## Software requirements
### Mechanical part
* Autodesk Fusion 360 (recommended)
* FreeCAD (optional)
### Electronic part
* KiCad
### Software testing
* Visual Studio Code with PlatformIO extension (recommended)
* Mbed OS (optional)
### Software utilities
* Jupyter Notebook
